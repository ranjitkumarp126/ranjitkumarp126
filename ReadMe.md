# 💫About Me :
👋 Hello there! I'm a passionate and research-driven B.Tech student specializing in Cybersecurity. My journey has been fueled by a relentless curiosity to understand the intricate world of digital security. With a hands-on approach, I've honed my skills in penetration testing, a field that truly captivates me.

🔍 My practical experience has been cultivated through immersive interactions with vulnerable labs on renowned platforms like TryHackMe and PortSwigger. These hands-on engagements have empowered me to navigate the complex web of security challenges and bolster my expertise in penetration testing.

💡 Beyond the classroom theories, I'm eager to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application. My sights are set on securing an Information Security Internship, where I can actively contribute, collaborate, and bring real value to the team. I'm excited to roll up my sleeves, dive into real-world scenarios, and fortify my skills through meaningful experiences.

🚀 My passion for cybersecurity is more than a career path – it's a relentless pursuit of excellence. I believe in the power of continuous learning, and I see each challenge as an opportunity to elevate my skills. Through this internship, I am ready to embark on a transformative journey of growth, learning, and making a tangible impact in the realm of information security.
